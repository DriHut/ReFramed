# ReFramed
## Overview
This Project is an unofficial port of [FramedBlocks](https://github.com/XFactHD/FramedBlocks) 
forked from [Templates 2](https://github.com/quat1024/templates-mod). 
It aims to add the same mechanics as [FramedBlocks](https://github.com/XFactHD/FramedBlocks) into Fabric.

For a complete Feature list please have a look at the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/reframed) page.

## Information
### Where to get it?
The mod can be downloaded on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/reframed).

### Issues/requests
Any issues/requests may be addressed on this repository in the [Issues](https://github.com/DriHut/ReFramed/issues) section.

### Out of date?
I will be adding new shapes as time passes, but I am currently not planing on keeping up with the newer versions of the game.
That said this mod is under permissive licenses and make it easy for anyone to create their own fork. 
If anyone in the future plans to do so, I will gladly either link it from here and the modrinth page,
or based on preferences add the person(s) to the project

### What Shapes are planed to be added
Currently, the list of shapes to be added is pretty simple as the mod is still under development:
- Fence
- Pressure Plate
- Carpet (maybe redundant with Layer)
- Post
- Half Slab (maybe redundant with Layer)
- Slabs Stair (a stair with one end being of a second theme, might be done in multiple blocks)

Any Ideas feel free to make a suggestion [here](https://github.com/DriHut/ReFramed/issues).
